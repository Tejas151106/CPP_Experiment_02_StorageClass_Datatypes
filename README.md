In this experiment, we explored how a basic C++ program is structured and got familiar with different built-in data types like int, float, double, char, bool, and string. We learned how to declare and initialize variables, take user input, and check how much memory each type uses. The code also helped us understand why we use #include and using namespace std to make writing and reading programs easier.

We also touched on storage classes like auto, static, and extern, which control how long a variable lives in memory and where it can be accessed from.
